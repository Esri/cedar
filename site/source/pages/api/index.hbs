# About Cedar

Cedar is a charting library that provides two primary aspects: Simple Charts that integrate with the ArcGIS Geoservices; Chart templates which enable new visualization types. The purpose is to enable developers the simplicity of visualizing with the ArcGIS platform and the freedom to explore and share new types of visualizations. 

## Components of a Cedar Chart

Cedar charts are defined by the following ingredients:

- a `Specification` is a JSON document which includes,
 - `inputs` that declare the variables of the chart such as category or value to be summarized
 - `template` is a declarative syntax for chart design using the [Vega](http://trifacta.github.io/vega/) visualization grammar. 
- a `dataset` 
 - either `url` link to the ArcGIS Feature Layer; 
 - ...or `values` can be an array of inline features
 - `mappings` bind the Feature Layer attributes to the `Specification inputs`
- and `overrides` are specific modifications to the `Specification template`

## Types of Charts

While Cedar provides a set of commonly used chart types including `Bar`, `Line`, `Scatterplot`, and `Pyramid` through use of the Vega grammar it is possible for developers to create unique and custom charts that can be used by other developers with new data sources. 

When starting with Cedar, we suggest that you begin by exploring the simple charts using your own data services. As you experiment with the interactions with Maps and more complex interaction you can also customize these charts with new capabilities such as legends, size scaling or labeling. Finally, you can fork and create completely custom chart templates that you then provide for other developers to use through Cedar.
