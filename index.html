  	<p>
  	Cedar is a Javascript library for crafting visualizations, in particular with the <a href="https://geoservices.github.io/">GeoServices API</a> from ArcGIS. This includes common chart types such as bar charts, line charts, scatterplots, as well as custom graphics designed with <a href="https://vega.github.io">Vega grammar</a>. Built on D3.js - Cedar is extensible and interactive.
